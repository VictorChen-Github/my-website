##### Abstract

This paper studies how racial residential integration (RRI) influences stock price efficiency. We find that communities with higher RRI exhibit more upward intergenerational mobility and a smaller White-Black income gap. Consistent with the idea that more integrated communities facilitate better information diffusion, firms headquartered in these regions demonstrate higher stock price informativeness and lower information asymmetry. Using staggered adoptions of source-of-income laws as exogenous shocks to RRI, we establish a causal relationship. Finally, we show that the superior local stock-picking ability of actively managed mutual funds is weakened for firms located in high RRI communities.
