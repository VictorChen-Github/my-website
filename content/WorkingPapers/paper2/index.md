summary: "Differences in what high- vs. low-skill mutual funds hold predict next-month factor returns (e.g., a one-decile rise signals ~0.30% higher HML), strongest for discretionary funds, reflecting informed tilts toward value, investment, and profitability premia."

##### Abstract

We show that mutual fund stock holdings contain predictive information about important common factors in stocksâ€™ returns. Specifically, we use differences between the holdings attributes of highly-skilled and low-skill mutual funds to forecast characteristic-related factor returns. For instance, we find that a one-decile increase in our measure forecasts a 30 bps increase in the value factor (HML) return in the following month. The predictive signal is concentrated among funds with greater discretion, such as growth funds. Our measure can be interpreted as an information variable that aggregates informed portfolio tilts towards forecasting factor premia tied to fundamentals, including value, investment, and profitability.
